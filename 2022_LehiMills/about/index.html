    <h1>About</h1>
<h3>Historical Use</h3>
<p>Lehi Roller Mills was originally built back in 1905
and was added to the National Register of Historical Places
in 1994. It was a family-owned business, and as the name implies, 
Lehi Roller Mills was used to mill quality wheat into flour. </p>

<h3>Current Use</h3>
<p>As of 2013, there was a change in ownership and the mill is now 
    rebranded as Lehi Mills. Lehi Mills only updates machinery and parts of 
    the building that need to be repaired as needed, to preserve its historical 
    significance. Many of the machines you will see are original 
    while some new machines have been added to the mill. Lehi Mills
    strives to stay true to their values and provide quality flour
    as it always has.</p>

<h3>Public Accessibility</h3>
<p>The only part of the mill that is accessible to the public 
    is the gift shop, where you can purchase a variety of 
    pre-made mixes and syrups.
</p>

<h3>Current Address</h3>
<p>833 E Main St, Lehi, UT 84043</p>
